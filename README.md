# Netflix Clone using only HTML and CSS
This is a very basic project. This is a clone of the Netflix front-end using only HTML and CSS.

---

### To-Do
* [ ] Use JS for basic logic. Pressing any button doesn't do anything right now
* [ ] Use appropriate font close to Netflix Sans
* [ ] Make it responsive for small-width screens (it is somewhat responsive now)
* [ ] Anything others suggest
